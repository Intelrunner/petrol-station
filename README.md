# PETROL STATION 

*AKA "PumpBaron"*

Note: If you see a TODO you can tackle, fix it and make a pull request. Please don't start highlighting bugs yet. The whole damn thing is a bug. 

## GitHub's only high-octane fuel station simulator for the modern age.
(This description partially written by GitHub CoPilot)

## What is it?

First and foremost - it's a side project I started in mid-September 2022. While this project and it's goals will evolve, that first line should always be true. I used to play textually-prominent games such as Drug Wars, Oregon Trail, Zorks Revenge, Apple Adventure, etc -  and I wanted to make a similar type of (evolving) application. This is my effort to do that.

## What is it not?

Finished, and ready for any kind of production activity. It's not professional, nor will it ever be.

## Why are you sharing so early?

Because it takes a village. I am not a developer by trade (I'm a cloudy infrastructure person), and I've never designed a game. I'm hoping people will take some of the TODOs, and run with them. I don't expect this to be done soon, or easily. My goal is to have a playable iteration with a rudimentary UI by the end of 2022. 

## Is this commercial?

No. It never will be, and neither can any property based off of it. When it's published for public enjoyment, it will likely have minor ad support to help pay for the infrastructure. The data will never be sold, and the code will remain open source.

## What makes this different

I want to try and evolve this into both a game, and a modeling simulation (of sorts). I don't think NodeJS is the right language for that, but time will tell. It's what I started with, so it's what I'm going to carry forward with. Oddly enough, it wasn't a really thought out decision, I just started coding the basic logics in JS and it seems to work alright so far.

## What's the goal?

World Domination of the free-to-play petrol simulation market.

## What's the current status?

It's more dream then reality.
